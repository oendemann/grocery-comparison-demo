Poopy eggs

I understand where eggs come from however when buying at a grocery store I expect them to be clean since they're not fresh. Fresh eggs are not near as old therefore contamination doesn't bother me like it does with store bought eggs that's are not fresh and the poop has had an opportunity to penetrate the pores of the eggs.

Eggs getting smaller

I have been buying Walmart brand eggs for years. No problems. Until the last two orders. At least 2 of the 12 eggs are noticeably smaller than the others. If this is Walmart's way of “shrink-flation” it's unacceptable. BE BETTER, Walmart!!

Cracked

Beware, personal shoppers either don't check to make sure your eggs aren't cracked or they don't take enough precautions to make sure that they don't get cracked before you receive them. Cracked eggs don't make good boiled eggs for egg salad or deviled eggs or just to have a good whole boiled egg! Maybe eggs is one of those things I need to pick up myself instead of having someone else to do it!
